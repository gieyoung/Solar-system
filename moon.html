            <span class="first-txt">The Moon</span> is Earth's only natural
            satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900
            mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth. Over time Earth's gravity
            has caused tidal locking, causing the same side of the Moon to
            always face Earth. Because of this, the lunar day and the lunar
            month are the same length, at 29.5 Earth days. The Moon's
            gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent, the Sun's – are the
            main drivers of Earth's tides. In geophysical terms the Moon is a
            planetary-mass object or satellite planet. Its mass is 1.2% that of
            the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly
            one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as Australia.) Within the
            Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in
            relation to its parent planet, the fifth largest and most massive
            moon overall, and larger and more massive than all known dwarf
            planets. Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about
            half of that of Mars, and the second highest among all Solar System
            moons, after Jupiter's moon Io. The body of the Moon is
            differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere,
            atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not
            long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact
            between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. The
            lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains,
            impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks and, mostly on the
            near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains of
            cooled magma. These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into
            ancient impact basins. The Moon is, except when passing through
            Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the
            Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its
            orbit, producing the lunar phases. The Moon is the brightest
            celestial object in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to its
            large angular diameter, while the reflectance of the lunar surface
            is comparable to that of asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the
            same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun completely
            during a total solar eclipse. From Earth about 59% of the lunar
            surface is visible over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective
            (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible. For
            humans the Moon has been an important source of inspiration and
            knowledge, having been crucial to cosmography, mythology, religion,
            art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. On September
            13, 1959, the first human-made object to reach an extraterrestrial
            body arrived on the Moon, the Soviet Union's Luna 2 impactor. In
            1966, the Moon became the first extraterrestrial body where soft
            landings and orbital insertions were achieved. On July 20, 1969,
            humans for the first time landed on the Moon and any
            extraterrestrial body, at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander Eagle
            of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. Five more crews were sent
            between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. The
            longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. Since then,
            exploration of the Moon has continued robotically with crewed
            missions being planned to return beginning in the late 2020s.
