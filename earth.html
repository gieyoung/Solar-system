                                    The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old.
                                    All of the planets, except for Earth, were
                                    named after Greek and Roman gods and
                                    goddesses. However, the name Earth is a
                                    Germanic word, which simply means “the
                                    ground.”

                                    in that most of our planet is covered in
                                    liquid water, since the temperature allows
                                    liquid water to exist for extended periods
                                    of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a

                                    the terrestrial planets and the fifth

                                    days to complete one trip around the Sun.
                                    That extra quarter of a day presents a
                                    challenge to our calendar system, which
                                    counts one year as 365 days. To keep our
                                    yearly calendars consistent with our orbit
                                    around the Sun, every four years we add one
                                    day. That day is called a leap day, and the

                                    Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling

Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate.</p>
