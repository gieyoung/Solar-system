                                    The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All
                                    of the planets, except for Earth, were named
                                    after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.
                                    However, the name Earth is a Germanic word,
                                    which simply means “the ground.”

                                    Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of
                                    our planet is covered in liquid water, since the
                                    temperature allows liquid water to exist for
                                    extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans
                                    provided a convenient place for life to begin

                                    (12,760 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the
                                    terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet
                                    in our solar system. From an average distance of
                                    93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth
                                    is exactly one astronomical unit away from the
                                    Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated
                                    as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.
                                    This unit provides an easy way to quickly
                                    compare planets' distances from the Sun. It
                                    takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun
                                    to reach our planet.

                                    As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one
                                    rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days
                                    to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra
                                    quarter of a day presents a challenge to our
                                    calendar system, which counts one year as 365
                                    days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent
                                    with our orbit around the Sun, every four years
                                    we add one day. That day is called a leap day,
                                    and the year it's added to is called a leap
                                    year.
